# Numba_DPPY_Essentials
Data Parallel Python (DPPY) Essentials Modules
The concepts build on top of each other introducing and reinforcing the concepts of Data Parallel Python (DPPY)

Module 0 - Introduction to Jupyter Notebook (Optional) 
Optional This module explains how to use Jupyter Notebook which is used in all of the modules to edit and run coding excecises, this can be skipped if you are already familiar with using Jupyter Notebooks.

Module 1 - Introduction to DPPY 
These initial hands-on exercises introduce you to concepts of Data Parallel Python. In addition, it familiarizes you how to execute on multiple devices using Data Parallel Python (DPPY), utilize Numba and Numba-DPPY to write paralle code on GPU and utitlize DPPY features to synchronize data from device to host

Module 2 - Introduction to dpCtl
These hands-on exercises present how to use Data parallel Control (dpCtl) to manage different devices, usage of the classes and the functions of dpCtl, how to use dpCtl Memory Python API to manage USM memory and usage of dpCtl for Memory Management in DPPY

Module 3 - DPPY Pairwise Distance Algorithm
These hands-on exercises show how to build a Numba implementation of Pairwise distance algorithm targeting CPU and GPU using Numba Jit approach, Kernel approach and build using Numpy approach

Module 4 - DPPY Black Scholes Algorithm
These hands-on exercises show how to build a Numba implementation of Black scholes algorithm targeting CPU and GPU using Numba Jit approach, Kernel approach and build using Numpy approach

Module 5 - DPPY Kmeans
These hands-on exercises show how to build a Numba implementation of Kmeans algorithm targeting CPU and GPU using Numba Jit approach, Kernel approach and build using Numpy approach
